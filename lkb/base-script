;;; Now the core grammar, which will typically be spread out

;;; (as they would unnecessarily clutter matrix.tdl).  You should
;;; rename my_language.tdl to something appropriate, and enter
;;; language-specific types there.  In larger grammars, it is common
;;; to separate out e.g. lexical types from construction types
;;; into distinct files.  All files containing types used in 
;;; the grammar should be mentioned in the following command.
